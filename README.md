# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a free 9-week course that teaches the fundamentals of **building data pipelines**.  

I got hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Terraform, Kestra, dbt, Spark, and Kafka, learning about everything from setting up infrastructure to working with streaming data.  
The final project really helped solidify what I learned and gave me a chance to apply it all.
